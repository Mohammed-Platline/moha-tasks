- 2026-02-21 17:44: Asked about enabling Web_Search/Brave but was reminded such browsing is blocked; repeated needs to summarize or create own references, and noted preference for straightforward conversation.
- 2026-02-21 19:47: Web_search diagnostics completed. Confirmed tool works end-to-end via OpenRouter (perplexity/sonar), direct OpenRouter API test returned OK, and gateway restarted to clear stale state. Likely root cause was session/context issue rather than API config.
- 2026-02-21 20:05: Added permanent runbook to MEMORY.md for Web_Search troubleshooting and LiveKit always-on + Telegram linkage, including fixed commands and behavior rules for any model.
- 2026-02-21 20:12: Added mandatory execution protocol to MEMORY.md for all models: send "الآن ببدأ" before long tasks, send "تم الانتهاء" after completion, and include a short completion summary.
